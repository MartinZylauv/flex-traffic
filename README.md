# FlexTraffik Computer Science exam 2016 EAMV 2. semester.
Welcome to our repository for our exam project for finishing our second semester at EAMV.

A quick few notes about the structure of this repository:

This projects programming is inside the src folder and consists of different packages which have the normal naming convention for the 
modelview-control design pattern.

The classpath and .project files must never be committed to this repository from your local repository.

Please place your documentation inside the "Dokumentation" folder with a proper naming of the file.

Please update the project plan when you are done with a step.

If you are using code from this project, we would like to ask you to include our names as authors of it, but only if the code is copied 
directly, if its just for inspiration, then go ahead and edit the code for your liking.

This project is mainly a solution for a bus service in Denmark, which can be ordered from an application to come pick citizens up,
mainly the eldery which needs some help with the helping-aids and luggage.

We made a solution in java, with all the nescessary graphs and diagrams which where a requirement from the assignment we got.

The process took 5 weeks from start to finish, including a 40 page paper on the project as a whole, and the work process within.

The project was presented on june 20th and got judged by our teachers. We both passed this exam.
